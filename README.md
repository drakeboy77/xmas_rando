Randomizer for Xmas Giving

This program is to create a pseudo-random series of gift giving responsibilities in a group.  

Future feature adds would be to remove the hard-coded names and add in either arguments from CLI or ask for user input for the names to make this more flexible. Another nice add might be to add in SMS text or email messaging.
